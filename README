# Automated Videos

This is a project to automate video creation using common slideshow techniques from categorized media by category.

## Theory

This project is inspired by ML and human memory theory.
It's my hypothesis that viewing media similar to what you want to create, even very briefly in the case of images, will lead to drastically better creative output.
I'm sure there are many applications this could be used for or tested on but I intend for this to "supercharge" my creativity and ability to improvise as a game master in Dungeons & Dragons.

## Getting Started

At the time of writing the program will create a composition of appropriate length and add images to it from an array of file paths.
Create your own .env file and add your media root folder's absolute path, don't add anything to the /media folder in this repo.

The plan is to use Elasticsearch to get the images paths after categorizing them, so this will be much more relevant later.

## Outstaind Questions

How to handle music? I'm kinda thinking Adobe Audition would be good to hook into because you can extend songs to virtually any duration.
Doing it this way would mean that the amount of images is the sole determining factor of how long each video is which I kind of like. 

How should outros be handled? Maybe have a pre-rendered outro and just toss it in there? Could probably be a lot more creative than that.
